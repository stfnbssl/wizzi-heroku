differently than normal style definitions.

The callback would return an array of CSS\n * rules like\n *\n *   ['.foo:nth-child(2n):hover{color:red !important;}']\n *\n * and the handler would then return that resulting CSS.\n *\n * `defaultSelectorHandlers` is the list of default handlers used in a call to\n * `generateCSS`.\n *\n * @name SelectorHandler\n * @function\n * @param {string} selector: The currently inspected selector. ':hover' in the\n *     example above.\n * @param {string} baseSelector: The selector of the parent styles.\n *     '.foo:nth-child(2n)' in the example above.\n * @param {function} generateSubtreeStyles: A function which can be called to\n *     generate CSS for the subtree of styles corresponding to the selector.\n *     Accepts a new baseSelector to use for generating those styles.\n * @returns {string[] | string | null} The generated CSS for this selector, or\n *     null if we don't handle this selector.\n */\n\nvar defaultSelectorHandlers\n/* : SelectorHandler[] */\n= [// Handle pseudo-selectors, like :hover and :nth-child(3n)\nfunction pseudoSelectors(selector, baseSelector, generateSubtreeStyles) {\n  if (selector[0] !== \":\") {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  return generateSubtreeStyles(baseSelector + selector);\n}, // Handle media queries (or font-faces)\nfunction mediaQueries(selector, baseSelector, generateSubtreeStyles) {\n  if (selector[0] !== \"@\") {\n    return null;\n  } // Generate the styles normally, and then wrap them in the media query.\n\n\n  var generated = generateSubtreeStyles(baseSelector);\n  return [\"\".concat(selector, \"{\").concat(generated.join(''), \"}\")];\n}];\n/**\n * Generate CSS for a selector and some styles.\n *\n * This function handles the media queries and pseudo selectors that can be used\n * in aphrodite styles.\n *\n * @param {string} selector: A base CSS selector for the styles to be generated\n *     with.\n * @param {Object} styleTypes: A list of properties of the return type of\n *     StyleSheet.create, e.g. [styles.red, styles.blue].\n * @param {Array.<SelectorHandler>} selectorHandlers: A list of selector\n *     handlers to use for handling special selectors.
