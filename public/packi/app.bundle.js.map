differently than normal style definitions.

The callback would return an array of CSS\n * rules like\n *\n *   ['.foo:nth-child(2n):hover{color:red !important;}']\n *\n * and the handler would then return that resulting CSS.\n *\n * `defaultSelectorHandlers` is the list of default handlers used in a call to\n * `generateCSS`.\n *\n * @name SelectorHandler\n * @function\n * @param {string} selector: The currently inspected selector. ':hover' in the\n *     example above.\n * @param {string} baseSelector: The selector of the parent styles.\n *     '.foo:nth-child(2n)' in the example above.\n * @param {function} generateSubtreeStyles: A function which can be called to\n *     generate CSS for the subtree of styles corresponding to the selector.\n *     Accepts a new baseSelector to use for generating those styles.\n * @returns {string[] | string | null} The generated CSS for this selector, or\n *     null if we don't handle this selector.\n */\n\nvar defaultSelectorHandlers\n/* : SelectorHandler[] */\n= [// Handle pseudo-selectors, like :hover and :nth-child(3n)\nfunction pseudoSelectors(selector, baseSelector, generateSubtreeStyles) {\n  if (selector[0] !== \":\") {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  return generateSubtreeStyles(baseSelector + selector);\n}, // Handle media queries (or font-faces)\nfunction mediaQueries(selector, baseSelector, generateSubtreeStyles) {\n  if (selector[0] !== \"@\") {\n    return null;\n  } // Generate the styles normally, and then wrap them in the media query.\n\n\n  var generated = generateSubtreeStyles(baseSelector);\n  return [\"\".concat(selector, \"{\").concat(generated.join(''), \"}\")];\n}];\n/**\n * Generate CSS for a selector and some styles.\n *\n * This function handles the media queries and pseudo selectors that can be used\n * in aphrodite styles.\n *\n * @param {string} selector: A base CSS selector for the styles to be generated\n *     with.\n * @param {Object} styleTypes: A list of properties of the return type of\n *     StyleSheet.create, e.g. [styles.red, styles.blue].\n * @param {Array.<SelectorHandler>} selectorHandlers: A list of selector\n *     handlers to use for handling special selectors.

The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\n * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?
